# AI-ness Scoring

Score 0–10 across six dimensions. Final AI-ness = average rounded to nearest integer.

---

## Scale

| Final score | Reading |
|---|---|
| 0–2 | Reads as natural human writing. |
| 3–4 | Mostly fine. Minor polish residue. |
| 5–6 | Noticeable AI influence. Several tells present. |
| 7–8 | Strong AI patterns. Multiple categories firing. |
| 9–10 | Obviously AI-generated. |

## Dimensions

Score each 0–10 (lower = more human).

### 1. Generic phrasing

How much of the text is corporate-fog vocabulary (TELL-004) or buzzword stacking (TELL-020)?
- 0 = none
- 5 = several abstract verbs / buzzwords without concrete meaning
- 10 = almost every sentence has at least one fog word

### 2. Structural predictability

Symmetric sentences, rule-of-three lists, parallel clauses, balanced bullets (TELL-009)?
- 0 = irregular, varied
- 5 = visibly patterned in places
- 10 = uniform throughout

### 3. Word-choice abstraction

Specific nouns/verbs/numbers vs. abstract claims (TELL-013)?
- 0 = concrete, named, quantified
- 5 = mix
- 10 = abstract throughout, no named entities or numbers

### 4. Tone neutrality

Personality vs. neutral-bot tone?
- 0 = clear voice and POV
- 5 = generic professional
- 10 = no perceivable author

### 5. Formatting / punctuation tells

Em dashes (TELL-001), fragment chains (TELL-005), setup colons (TELL-019), forced bullets, emoji clusters?
- 0 = clean
- 5 = a few visible tells
- 10 = formatting *is* the AI signal

### 6. Opening / closing clichés

Generic openings (TELL-003), forced conclusions (TELL-007), motivational closers, em-fragment closers (TELL-016)?
- 0 = both ends land naturally
- 5 = one end is templated
- 10 = both ends are pure template

## Output format for `check` and `score-only` modes

```
AI-ness: 7/10

Sub-scores:
- Generic phrasing: 8
- Structural predictability: 7
- Word abstraction: 8
- Tone neutrality: 6
- Formatting tells: 7
- Opening/closing: 6

Top issues:
1. [TELL-002] Fake contrast formula in line 1
   Excerpt: "It's not just X — it's Y"
   Fix: state Y directly.
2. [TELL-004] Corporate fog: "leverage", "robust", "ecosystem"
   Excerpt: "leverage our robust ecosystem"
   Fix: replace with concrete actions.
3. [TELL-001] Em dashes used 4× in 3 paragraphs
   Fix: replace with periods/commas.

Fix direction: cut openers, kill em dashes, replace abstract verbs with concrete outcomes.
